    "sentence = \"In most cases, requirement analysis is performed to determine the system function and user interface. It enables users to comprehend system functionality and developers to understand the system requirements. The requirements analysis' principal task is to identify system use cases diagram and create a system requirements model. The use of case diagram, state machine diagram and sequence diagram are the major outcomes. Requirements analysis phase First, we are analysing and refine the requirements of the system. In addition, Listing the involved operators in the system and identify all the use cases and roles to describe. And then to analyse the relationship between the roles and the cases and use UML modelling tool to draw the case diagram.  System analysis and design phase Identify all the needs of the system. Abstract the classes from the actual needs and describe the relationship between these classes. Extracting our attributes, actors, and classes from analysing our text in the Natural Language Processing with Python (NLP) using NLTK library. Phase of system implementation The model in the first two phases is actually created in a system logic aspect. This phase is to accomplish the physical realization of the system, such as main classes, operators or associations and attributes. The library information management system is an electronic archives management system that processes a large number of book information using a computer. The needs of three sorts of users must be met by this system: member, librarians, author and library (to check for another branch if found). Many individuals can be categorized as user or a librarian based on their status, and only one person serves as the system administrator. The readers’ behaviour is to query the personal information, to query the books, to book, borrow and return them. In case of the due date of borrowing a book has passed, the member will be obliged to pay a fine. A library database must store information about its members, librarian, and the rack number of the book where it can be found. Each book item's status, descriptive attributes, and cost for losses and late returns must be tracked by the library/librarian. The ISBN of books will be used to identify them. Each book will have a unique ISBN in order to allow multiple copies of the same book. For the users to be a member they need to apply for a library card, where details about the member can identified (card number, barcode, issue date and active status). Furthermore, when applying for a library card, members must create an account, then they will be given, unique ID, their names, and password (that can be reset later after account activation by librarian). In addition, a library card will be required for checkout operations. The library card will have its own fines, but any outstanding fines on a member’s cards will prevent them from using the library's services. The system's primary users are librarians. They are in charge of day-to-day management and service operations such as book ordering, new book verification, book registration, borrow and return books from members and so on. The librarians are also in charge of all issues concerning books, including book status (borrowed, not found and etc), library management (to check if the book can be found in another branch). The key point among them is system maintenance, which includes the maintenance of member rights and account details, the creation and activation/deactivation of members’ account, fine payment, and so on. For further elaboration, check our Library Management System (Librarian) state machine diagram – This diagram depicts the activities and scenarios that occur when a member checks out a book. The actions and decisions were all highlighted in the state machine diagram see figure 2. While designing our Library Management System, we will concentrate on the following requirements: Books should be searchable by title, author, subject category, and publication date for any library member. Each book will have a unique identification number as well as other details such as a rack number that will aid in physically locating the book. A book might have multiple copies, and library users should be able to borrow and reserve any of them. Each copy of a book will be referred to as a book item. The system should be able to retrieve information such as who took a specific book or what books are checked out by a specific library member. There should be a maximum limit of 5 books that a member can check out. A member should be allowed to keep a book for a maximum of 10 days. For books returned after the due date, the user/customer must pay a fine. Members should be able to reserve books that are currently unavailable. The system should be able to send notifications when reserved books become available, as well as when the book is not returned by the due date. Each book and member will have their own barcode. The system will be able to read barcodes from books as well as library cards from members. In our system, there are three main actors: Librarians are primarily in charge of adding and modifying books, book items, and users. In addition, the Librarian can issue, reserve, and return book items. Member: All members have access to the catalogue and can check out, reserve, renew, and return books. System: Is primarily in charge of sending notifications for overdue books, cancelled reservations, and so on. Our Library Management System is divided into the following classes: Library: The heart of the organization for which this software was created. It has attributes such as 'Name' to differentiate it from other libraries and 'Address' to describe its location, the class should be able to identify in which branch is the book located Book: The system's fundamental building block. Every book will have an ISBN, a title, and subject. Book Item: Any book can have multiple copies, and each copy is treated as a book item in our system. Each book will have its own barcode. In addition, giving information if the book is borrowed and when it should be returned by the members’ user. Information also about the publication date of the book and date of purchase if the member bought it. As an operation process; librarian should be able to check out the book Account: There will be two types of accounts in the system, one for general members and one for librarians, where every class will have its own id, password and username. Member or librarian should be able to reset their passwords. Library Card: A library card will be issued to each library user, which will be used to identify users when issuing or returning books. Where there will be a unidirectional association with the Account details. Additionally, it should hold information like card number, barcode, issue date and account status. Book Reservation: In charge of managing reservations for book items based on the creation date and status. If the account is active book reservation can be confirmed Book Lending: Manage the loaning of books. Due date & return date should be known. Catalogue: A list of books sorted according to certain criteria. Our system will allow you to search four catalogues by title, author, subject, and publish date. Fines: in case the lend book is not returned by the due date specified in the Book Lending class; This class will be in charge of calculating and collecting fines from library patrons. Bill: this class will be referred from the transaction to be paid by the member. And librarian will be able to create, issue and update bill. Author: This class will focus on the author of a book, storing name of the book and a brief description. Rack: Books will be arranged on shelves. Each rack will be identified by a rack number and a location identifier that describes the rack's physical location in the library. Notification: This class will handle sending notifications to library users to their email addresses.\""
